# week_1:

Title: **Traffic Control and Urban Mobility via YOLOv7** 

- The project is based on vehicle detection in high-density areas, which can be connected to the city's traffic heatmap and thereby moderate traffic levels to ensure minimal gridlocks.

- As of now, datasets are imported, and a basic framework for the model is designed.

#  week_2:

- Scripts are created for data re-labelling and merging

- Using labelImg, the datasets are custom-labelled for better recognition and operability under different conditions

- A config file is also created, prepping for training the model.
