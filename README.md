Title: **Traffic Control and Urban Mobility via YOLOv7** 

- The project is based on vehicle detection in high-density areas, which can be connected to the city's traffic heatmap and thereby moderate traffic levels to ensure minimal gridlocks.

- As of now, datasets are imported, and a basic framework for the model is designed.
